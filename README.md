# American Express User Exit Prediction

## Project Description:

This repository provides a basic implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer exits for American Express. It's designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrates common data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites:

* Python 3.x
* Required libraries: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)ar-Archith/American-Express-User-Exit-Prediction.git
2. **Install Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. **Open the Notebook:**
   Launch American_Express_Data_Analysis.ipynb in your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. **Run the Code:**
   Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure:

American_Express_Data_Analysis.ipynb: Contains the Python code for the project.
American_Express_User_Exit_Prediction.csv: The dataset used for the project.

## Usage:

The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization
- Data preprocessing
- Model building (ANN)
- Model training
- Model evaluation

## Note:

This is a basic implementation. You can modify and experiment with the code to explore different techniques and improve model performance.
